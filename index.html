  <p><i><b> Hello world. This is my first website!</p></i></b>
<h1>About Myself</h1>
   <p>	I am a student in ITMD-361 and this is my first time taking HTML. I was born in Chicago, but I have lived for more than 10 years in the Middle East. My hobbies are singing and playing sports.
   My dream job was in the field of Cybersecurity, I always wanted to be an ethical hacker. However, I did my associates in Cybersecurity, and I plan on doing my masters for Cybersecurity. I have a lot of hopes for the future and plans to enhance my studies, so I can get to my dream job.
   I will be taking internships very soon, and applying for jobs as well.</p>
